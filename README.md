# Single-Cycle-Microprocessor-Datapath

This is an academic project. Visualization of datapaths of a single-cycle processor for different instructions is the main goal of this project. Two LED matrices are used to visualize the datapath and a LCD display is used to show the corresponding instruction. Two independent ESP32 microcontrollers are used to program the LED matrcies and LCD display. For power supply, we used 5V 10A SMPS (Switched Mode Power Supply).
